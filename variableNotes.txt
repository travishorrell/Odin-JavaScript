// variable names must contain only Letters, Digits, or the symbols $ and _
// the first charater must not be a digit

//Examples of vaild names
//let userName;
//let test123;

//These are fine because the both start with a letter and not a digit
//These names are vaild also

//let $ = 1;
//let _ = 2;

//These are vaild names but they don't convay good meaning of the data in the variable.
//Variable should be named shouldthing you will remeber and understand from the vaiable name.

//Exmaples of good variable names
//let firstName = 'Travis'
//let address = '1234 main st'
//let age = 23

//Examples of incrrect variable names
//let 1a; This is incorrect becuase it started with a digit
//let my-name; this is incorrect becuase it has a hyphen in the name which is a invalid charater for variables.

//Case matters in vaiable names
//apple and APPLE are two different variablein java script
